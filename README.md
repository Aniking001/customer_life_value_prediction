**Customer Lifetime Value Calculation Readme**

This repository contains a Python script for calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using transactional data from an online retail dataset. CLV is a crucial metric for businesses as it helps in understanding the long-term value generated by customers over their entire relationship with the company.

**Files Included:**
1. **CLV_Calculation.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook file contains the Python script for calculating CLV. It walks through the process step-by-step, including data preprocessing, frequency/recency analysis, model fitting, and CLV calculation.
2. **OnlineRetail.csv:** Sample dataset used for CLV calculation. This dataset contains transactional records including customer IDs, invoice dates, quantities, unit prices, and total sales.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, lifetimes

**Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository or download the files locally.
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib lifetimes
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `CLV_Calculation.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to run the script.
5. The script will perform data preprocessing, model fitting, and CLV calculation. Results will be displayed within the notebook.
6. You can modify the script or dataset as per your requirements.

**Note:**
- Make sure to replace the dataset file (`OnlineRetail.csv`) with your own dataset if you're using custom data.
- This script assumes basic familiarity with Python and data analysis concepts.
- For any questions or issues, feel free to open an issue in the repository or reach out to the author.
